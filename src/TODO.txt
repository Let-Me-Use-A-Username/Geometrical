|)Begin testing on android
	|) Fix controls and screen
	|) Joystick: https://github.com/MarcoFazioRandom/Virtual-Joystick-Godot

	|) Movement will have a virtual joystick.
		|) Abilities are either pressed, or pressed and activated with touch 
		|) Dash is a swipe
		
|)Fix ability choosing in android (changed buttons dont appear)

NOTES) Changes Input device -> mouse now emulates touch 
NOTES) Changes scretch mode to viewport in window

|)Implement event system for abilities 
IDEA) Make collider visible during dashing



|) Implement basic sound effects and background music
|) Implement virtual controller for mobile
|) Implement game menu and loading
|) Add more abilities 
|) Add bosses
|) Add FX
|) Fix threshold detection for level up
|) Roll Alpha Version

Ideas:
	|) Control player with mouse for pc
	
	|) Implement a better health bar
	
	|) Enemies that aren't instakilled could display an on hit effect 
		like a sprite change
	
	|) higher difficulties with increasingly smarter or bigger enemies
		-The more edges in a shape the more clever it is

Notes for later:
	|)Triangle movement could be more sofisticated
	|)Create sound effects and music


Note for much later:
	|)Timer and Spawned enemies could be better perhaps, will have to check it out later 
	|)Refine collition detection
	|)Refine spawn factory settings (spawn timer, spawn enemies, conditions etc.)
	|)Players UI should have icons instead of text


Done:
	Implement health bar
		Implement different colour for different health level
	SOS) Change the damage and collision implementation
	|) Implement correct detection for the dash attack
	|) Dashing could disable collision detection 
	|) Implement dash cooldown which can be enhanced with abilities
	|) Implement in game ui to see cooldown and abilities
	|) Implement health bar
	|) Fix how the bullet damages the enemy 
	|) Fix bullet movement
	|) Fix triangles movement to maintain set distance from player
	|) Kill bullets after 10 seconds
	|) Implement square
	|) Fix UI to not bug when player dies (player ui)
	Done) Fix quit menu that doesnt react to died signal
	Done) Fix "Freeze time" mechanic for enemies
	|) Implement basic level up and ability choosing
	|) Differentiate between Utility upgrades for the player and for the game
		changes have to be made in upgrade_factory
		|) Perhaps the player will be able to choose a game upgrade instead 
			of an ability upgrade more rarely. So as to change the game as he pleases
	Note) Consider the fact of changing the way a player picks an ability. 
		If a player is allowed to pick any type of upgrade then the only thing to 
		take into mind is how much he can upgrade something.
	Done)Back Button should keep the previous upgrades instead of changing them
