Ideas:

		|)Change spawn parameters accordingly
	
	Idea) Control player with mouse for pc
	
	Idea) Implement a better health bar
	
	Idea) Enemies that aren't instakilled could display an on hit effect 
		like a sprite change
	
	Idea) higher difficulties with increasingly smarter or bigger enemies
		-The more edges in a shape the more clever it is
		
	Idea)generate a map from a noise map. 
		|) High and low points should be a different tile, but gameplay wise nothing changes, it is only for the graphics
	
	IDEA) Create a zone(like the gray one) outside of that zone is the void. No sound, and damage over time 
	(that can be sustainable for some kind of play)
	
	IDEA) Create points in the area where if you dash on to it you are redirected in an other direction 
	(like a pin ball on an arcade)
