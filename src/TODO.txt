|)Timer and Spawned enemies
	NOTE) Enemies are spawned linearly to the clock time, 1=1, 2=2...
		DONE) Enemies should spawn faster after aquiring an ability

|) Fix threshold detection for level up
	Idea) player can pick any upgrade except for abilities which should be available 3 times in the game
			|)Coins=10 First upgrade should be from Explotion, Timefreeze, Rings
			|)Coints=30(or 50) Second upgrade should be from Supercharge, Spaceshift, Gunslinger
			|)Coints=50(or 110) Last upgrade should be from all
				TODO) Have a flag for each upgrade tier on the abilities
			


|) Make buttons appear a specific place from canvas layer layout
|) Implement basic sound effects and background music
|) Implement game menu and loading
|) Add bosses

Ideas:
	Idea) Let the player choose how many enemies to start, and how much time to play
		|)Change spawn parameters accordingly
	
	Idea) Control player with mouse for pc
	
	Idea) Implement a better health bar
	
	Idea) Enemies that aren't instakilled could display an on hit effect 
		like a sprite change
	
	Idea) higher difficulties with increasingly smarter or bigger enemies
		-The more edges in a shape the more clever it is
		
	Idea)generate a map from a noise map. 
		|) High and low points should be a different tile, but gameplay wise nothing changes, it is only for the graphics
	
	IDEA) Make collider visible during dashing

	Notes)Touch button: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_touchscreenbutton.html
	NOTES) Changes Input device -> mouse now emulates touch 
	NOTES) Changes scretch mode to viewport in window
	NOTE) All enemies now check to see if they should take damage WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GUNSLINGER_AREA
		Could be used for other areas2d as well
	NOTE)How spawn works:
		Time begins at 1, spawns 3 enemies.
			Every time the clock fires the timer adds 1 second, and we add 1 to enemies
			So for time=2, enemies=4, time=3, enemies=5
				Enemies are spawned outside of the players camera, specifically 
				they are spawned at the coordinates [-screen_size, screen_size]
				so they can be spanwed a "monitor" away, and never clip in the camera.

	Note) Consider the fact of changing the way a player picks an ability. 
		If a player is allowed to pick any type of upgrade then the only thing to 
		take into mind is how much he can upgrade something.
