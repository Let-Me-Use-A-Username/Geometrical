Ideas:
	|) Control player with mouse for pc
	
	|) Implement a better health bar
	
	|) Enemies that aren't instakilled could display an on hit effect 
		like a sprite change
	
	|) higher difficulties with increasingly smarter or bigger enemies
		-The more edges in a shape the more clever it is
		
	Idea)generate a map from a noise map. 
		|) High and low points should be a different tile, but gameplay wise nothing changes, it is only for the graphics
	IDEA) Make collider visible during dashing

	Done) Fix "Freeze time" mechanic for enemies
	|) Implement basic level up and ability choosing
	|) Differentiate between Utility upgrades for the player and for the game
		changes have to be made in upgrade_factory
		|) Perhaps the player will be able to choose a game upgrade instead 
			of an ability upgrade more rarely. So as to change the game as he pleases
	Note) Consider the fact of changing the way a player picks an ability. 
		If a player is allowed to pick any type of upgrade then the only thing to 
		take into mind is how much he can upgrade something.
	Done)Back Button should keep the previous upgrades instead of changing them
	Done)Export to android: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NxYJgATevg
