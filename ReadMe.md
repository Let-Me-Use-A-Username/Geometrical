Geometrical is my first try on creating my own game.

The game currently features an endless mode where the player must survive round by collecting coins 
and picking abilities.

The game is designed using Godot 4.2 but due to bugs regarding publishing, the game is written exlusively
with GDScript and is meant to be played on android deviced.
